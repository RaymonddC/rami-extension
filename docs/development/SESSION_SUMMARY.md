## 🎨 New Features

### 1. **Smart Mindmap Generation**
**Before:**
- Only worked from right-click
- No feedback during generation
- Used simple word splitting

**After:**
- ✅ Works from popup button
- ✅ Works from right-click
- ✅ 2-minute timeout for AI
- ✅ Smart fallback if AI fails
- ✅ Loading indicators
- ✅ Clear badges showing which method used

### 2. **Visual Indicators**
**AI Generated Badge:**
```
🤖 AI Generated (green)
```

**Fallback Badge:**
```
⚡ Fallback Mode (yellow)
```

### 3. **Delete Readings**
- Hover over reading → Red trash icon appears
- Click → Confirmation dialog
- Delete → Removed from storage and UI
- Auto-clears selection if needed

### 4. **Better Connections**
- Main concept connects to 3-4 secondary concepts
- Secondary concepts connect to neighbors
- Every 2nd concept connects back to main
- Creates hub-and-spoke pattern

### 5. **Separate Loading States**
- Summarize button has own loader
- Mindmap button has own loader
- No interference between features

---

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### 1. **Error Handling**
```javascript
// Before: Silent failures
// After: Comprehensive try-catch with logging
try {
  const result = await extractConcepts(...);
  if (result.success) {
    // Success path
  } else {
    // Graceful fallback
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('💥 Error:', error);
  alert('Clear error message');
}
```

### 2. **Timeout Management**
```javascript
// 2-minute timeout with Promise.race
const response = await Promise.race([
  session.prompt(fullPrompt),
  new Promise((_, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('timeout')), 120000)
  )
]);
```

### 3. **State Management**
```javascript
// Separate states prevent interference
const [loadingSummary, setLoadingSummary] = useState(false);
const [loadingMindmap, setLoadingMindmap] = useState(false);
```

### 4. **Data Tracking**
```javascript
// Every reading now tracks generation method
{
  title: "Article",
  concepts: [...],
  generationMethod: "language-model-api" | "fallback",
  usedAI: true | false
}
```

## 📊 Performance

### Text Extraction
- **Before:** 5,000 characters
- **After:** 50,000 characters (10x increase)

### AI Timeout
- **Before:** 10 seconds (too short)
- **After:** 120 seconds (2 minutes - ample time)

### Generation Speed
- **Right-click:** <1 second (uses fast mock)
- **Popup with AI:** 5-30 seconds (then fallback if needed)
- **Popup timeout → fallback:** 120 seconds max
