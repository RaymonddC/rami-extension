# 🔧 Rebuild Instructions

## ✅ What Changed

I've updated the code to:
1. ✅ Support both `'available'` and `'readily'` status
2. ✅ Add `outputLanguage: 'en'` to remove warnings
3. ✅ Support both new and old AI APIs
4. ✅ Better error messages and fallbacks

## 🚀 How to Rebuild on Windows

### Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in project folder:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd D:\raymond\Documents\DESKTOP\Projects\rami-extension

# Clean rebuild (if needed)
rmdir /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json
npm install

# Build
npm run build
```

### Or if npm works directly:

```bash
npm run build
```

## ✅ After Rebuild

1. **Reload extension** in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click reload icon on AI Reading Studio

2. **Test Summarizer Again**:
   - Visit any article
   - Click extension icon
   - Click "Summarize Page"
   - Should now show: `🤖 AI` instead of `📝 Fallback`

3. **Check Console** (F12):
   ```
   🤖 Using new Summarizer API
   ✅ No more language warnings!
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before (Fallback):
```
🧊 The Analyst
📝 Fallback
[Simple text extraction]
```

### After (With AI):
```
🧊 The Analyst
🤖 AI
[Intelligent summary with Analyst tone]
```

## 🐛 If Build Fails

Try using npx:
```bash
npx vite build
```

Or use the previous successful build - it's already in `dist/` folder!
